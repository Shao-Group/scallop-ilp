# Scallop-ilp
Scallop-ilp is a reference-based transcript assembler. 
Transcript assembly is often formulated as a graph decomposition problem needing multiple-objective optimization. 
Scallop-ilp is developed based on [scallop](https://github.com/Kingsford-Group/scallop)(v0.10.4). 
They have the same pipeline to generate splice graph for each loci,
but different algorithms for graph decomposition. 
Scallop-ilp solves the graph decomposition problem by Integer Linear Programming(ILP) with the help of [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com) optimizer.
Scripts to analyze the results and performance of scallop-ilp can be found at [scallop-ilp-test](https://github.com/Shao-Group/scallop-ilp-test).

## Pre-installed dependencies
Scallop-ilp requires two external libraries:[Boost](https://www.boost.org) and [htslib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib).
It also relies on Gurobi solver to deal with ILP. 
If these dependencies have not been installed in your machine, you may take following steps to obtain them.

### Install Gurobi
If Gurobi has not been installed, download Gurobi [(license)](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/licenses/) from (https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-software/).
Typically, Gurobi needs users to apply their license first. 
You may obtain a free trial academic license or purchase a commercial license.
Uncompress it and add the path to Gurobi to your enronmental variable:
```
export GUROBI_HOME=/path/to/your/gurobi
export PATH=${PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/bin
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${GUROBI_HOME}/lib
```


### Download Boost
If Boost has not been downloaded/installed, download Boost
[(license)](http://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt) from (http://www.boost.org).
Uncompress it somewhere (compiling and installing are not necessary).

### Install htslib
If htslib has not been installed, download htslib 
[(license)](https://github.com/samtools/htslib/blob/develop/LICENSE)
from (http://www.htslib.org/) with version 1.5 or higher.
Note that htslib relies on zlib. So if zlib has not been installed in your system,
you need to install zlib first. To do so, download zlib
[(license)](https://zlib.net/zlib_license.html) at (https://zlib.net/).
Use the following commands to install zlib:
```
./configure
make
make install
```
After installing zlib, use the following commands to build htslib:
```
./configure --disable-bz2 --disable-lzma --disable-gcs --disable-s3 --enable-libcurl=no
make
make install
```
The default installation location of htslib is `/usr/lib`.
If you would install it to a different location, replace the above `configure` line with
the following (by adding `--prefix=/path/to/your/htslib` to the end):
```
./configure --disable-bz2 --disable-lzma --disable-gcs --disable-s3 --enable-libcurl=no --prefix=/path/to/your/htslib
```
In this case, you also need to export the runtime library path (note that there
is an additional `lib` following the installation path):
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/your/htslib/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

## Compile Scallop-ilp
```
./configure --with-htslib=/path/to/your/htslib --with-boost=/path/to/your/boost
make
```

If some of the dependencies are installed in the default system directory (for example, `/usr/lib`),
then the corresponding `--with-` option might not be necessary.
The executable file `scallop-ilp` will appear at `src/scallop-ilp`.


## Usage

The usage of `scallop-ilp` is:
```
./scallop-ilp -i <input.bam> -o <output.gtf> [options]
```

The `input.bam` is the read alignment file generated by some RNA-seq aligner, (for example, TopHat2, STAR, or HISAT2).
Make sure that it is sorted; otherwise run `samtools` to sort it:
```
samtools sort input.bam > input.sort.bam
```

The reconstructed transcripts shall be written as gtf format into `output.gtf`.

Scallop-ilp support the following parameters. Please refer
to the additional explanation below the table.

 Parameters | Default Value | Description
 ------------------------- | ------------- | ----------
 --help  | | print usage of Scallop-ilp and exit
 --version | | print version of Scallop-ilp and exit
 --preview | | show the inferred `library_type` and exit
 --verbose | 1 | chosen from {0, 1, 2}
 --library_type               | empty | chosen from {empty, unstranded, first, second}
 --min_transcript_coverage    | 1 | the minimum coverage required to output a multi-exon transcript
 --min_single_exon_coverage   | 20 | the minimum coverage required to output a single-exon transcript
 --min_transcript_length_base      |150 | the minimum base length of a transcript
 --min_transcript_length_increase  | 50 | the minimum increased length of a transcript with each additional exon
 --min_mapping_quality        | 1 | ignore reads with mapping quality less than this value
 --max_num_cigar              | 7 | ignore reads with CIGAR size larger than this value
 --min_bundle_gap             | 50 | the minimum distances required to start a new bundle
 --min_num_hits_in_bundle     | 20 | the minimum number of reads required in a bundle
 --min_flank_length           | 3 | the minimum match length required in each side for a spliced read
 --min_splice_bundary_hits    | 1 | the minimum number of spliced reads required to support a junction

1. For `--verbose`, 0: quiet; 1: one line for each splice graph; 2: details of graph decomposition.

2. `--library_type` is highly recommended to provide. The `unstranded`, `first`, and `second`
correspond to `fr-unstranded`, `fr-firststrand`, and `fr-secondstrand` used in standard Illumina
sequencing libraries. If none of them is given, i.e., it is `empty` by default, then Scallop-ilp
will try to infer the `library_type` by itself (see `--preview`). Notice that such inference is based
on the `XS` tag stored in the input `bam` file. If the input `bam` file do not contain `XS` tag,
then it is essential to provide the `library_type` to Scallop-ilp. You can try `--preview` to see
the inferred `library_type`.

3. `--min_transcript_coverage` is used to filter lowly expressed transcripts: Scallop-ilp will filter
out transcripts whose (predicted) raw counts (number of moleculars) is less than this number.

4. `--min_transcript_length_base` and `--min_transcript_length_increase` is combined to filter
short transcripts: the minimum length of a transcript is given by `--min_transcript_length_base`
\+ `--min_transcript_length_increase` * num-of-exons-in-this-transcript. Transcripts that are less
than this number will be filtered out.
